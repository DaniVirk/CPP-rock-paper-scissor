# Rock Paper Scissors in C++

This is a beginner-level project written in C++ that simulates a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game between the player and the computer.

## 📚 Purpose

This project was created as part of my learning journey in C++ programming. It helped me practice:

- Basic syntax and structure of C++
- Control flow (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Random number generation
- User input and output
- Writing clean and readable code

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer randomly picks its choice.
3. The winner is determined based on classic game rules.
4. The result is displayed in the terminal.
